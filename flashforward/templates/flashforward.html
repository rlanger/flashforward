<p>Welcome to the Blender Animation tutorial.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HnY_Js5fxSQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>On your screen you should see what looks like a solid grey square with the outline of a yellow box around it.</p>

<ol>
<li>In a panel underneath the square are three labels: "Right", "Left", and "Squish". To the right of each of these labels is a little input area with the number "0.000" inside.
	<br>Click inside the input area next to each of these labels, and drag to the right until the number inside goes to "1.000". Drag back to the left to reset the key shape value to 0.000.
	</li>

<li>To the right, there's a vertical green bar with the number 0 at the base. Hover your cursor over this area and press the right arrow key until the number next to the green bar is "15". You are now 15 frames into your animation.</li>

<li>Change the value of Right to 1.000. </li>

<li>Continue hovering your mouse over this panel and use the right arrow key to move the green bar forward to frame 30.</li>

<li>Change the value of Right to 0.000. While you're here, slide the value of Left up a little and then back down to 0.000. This fixes the value of Left to 0.000 in this frame.</li>

<li>Use the right arrow key to move the green bar forward to frame 45. </li>

<li>Change the value of Left to 1.000.</li>

<li>Move the green bar to frame 60.</li>

<li>Change the value of Left to 0.000 and fix the value of Squish at 0.000.</li>

<li>Move the green bar to frame 75.</li>

<li>Change the value of Squish to 1.000.</li>

<li>Move the green bar to frame 90.</li>

<li>Change the value of Squish to 0.000.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your first animation is now complete! Press Alt-A to watch a preview of the animation. Press ESC to stop the preview.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning! In time, you'll learn to animate many different attributes of a shape, animate complex shapes, and render your animations to make polished 3D animated movies.</p>

<p>First though, you'll have to go back to the very beginning and learn the basics of 3D animation in Blender.</p>
